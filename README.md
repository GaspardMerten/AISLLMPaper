# Ground Truth for Using LLMs in AIS Data Analysis

## Overview  
This repository contains the **ground truth dataset** used to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in analyzing **Automatic Identification System (AIS) data**.  

The dataset (`ground_truth.csv`) provides verified answers to a set of **27 maritime queries**, serving as a benchmark for assessing LLM-based methods in AIS data analysis.  

## Dataset Description  
The `ground_truth.csv` file includes manually verified answers to queries categorized into four types:  
1. **Attribute Queries** - Extracting ship-related attributes  
2. **Spatial Queries** - Identifying vessel locations and movements  
3. **Trajectory-Based Queries** - Analyzing ship movement patterns  
4. **Complex Reasoning Queries** - Inferring insights from AIS data  

This dataset allows for a structured evaluation of **LLM performance in maritime data analysis**.  

## Usage  
Researchers and practitioners can use `ground_truth.csv` to:  
- **Evaluate LLM performance** in AIS data reasoning  
- **Compare different LLM-based approaches**  
- **Validate NLP-driven spatial and temporal queries**
